# PayStuff
Playing with WebAPI, knockoutjs, and stuff.

## Dev Notes
This only handles employees. It needs to be expanded to handle named dependents as well. May get a bit of time to address that issue.

It's split into two projects. PayStuffWeb holds all the http-ish bits for the web app. PayStuffLib has all the logical bits.

## File Notes
PayStuff-soapui-project.xml has some tests in it for the WebAPI bits.

The three src/*.sql files have the two table defs, and a bit of dummy data.
